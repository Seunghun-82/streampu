# AFF3CT-core

`AFF3CT-core` is a Domain-Specific Embedded Language (DSEL) for streaming 
applications written in C++. In this document, we try to explain the basics 
elements of the language:

- [Module & Task](1_module_task.md)
- [Socket](2_socket.md)
- [Sequence & Subsequence](3_sequence.md)
- [Pipeline](4_pipeline.md)  
- [Control flow](5_switcher.md)

Then we introduce the new features, and the modifications made to support them:

- [Forward sockets](6_socket_fwd.md)
- [Pipeline & Control Flow](7_pipeline_ctrl_flow.md)
- [Work in Progress](8_wip.md)
