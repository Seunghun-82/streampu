# Pipeline

Pipelines is a feature offered by `AFF3CT-core` allowing the breaking of a
[sequence](sequence.md) into multiple [stages](#Stage), each executed on one
or multiple threads in parallel.

![Image non affich√©e !](./assets/sequence_to_pipeline.svg)

## Attributes

```cpp 
Sequence original_sequence;
``` 
The original sequence from which the pipeline was created.

<a name="Stage"></a>
```cpp 
std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Sequence>> stages;
``` 
Vector of the different stages in the pipeline. Each stage is a
[sequence](sequence.md) in and of itself.

```cpp
std::vector<std::pair<std::tuple<runtime::Socket*, size_t, size_t, size_t,size_t>,
            std::tuple<runtime::Socket*, size_t, size_t, size_t>>> sck_orphan_binds;
```
Vector of [sockets](socket.md) with broken connections due to the pipeline
stages creation (hence "orphan"). These sockets will be bound later to special
modules called [adaptors](#Adaptor) to make bridges between the stages.

```cpp
std::vector<std::tuple<runtime::Socket*, runtime::Socket*, size_t>> adaptors_binds;
```
Vector of tuple (`input`, `output`, `priority`) of the created adaptors, 
`priority` is used to order the tuples.

## Methods

```cpp
void init(const std::vector<TA*> &firsts,
          const std::vector<TA*> &lasts,
          const std::vector<std::tuple<std::vector<TA*>, std::vector<TA*>, std::vector<TA*>>> &sep_stages = {},
          const std::vector<size_t> &n_threads = {},
          const std::vector<size_t> &synchro_buffer_sizes = {},
          const std::vector<bool> &synchro_active_waiting = {},
          const std::vector<bool> &thread_pinning = {},
          const std::vector<std::vector<size_t>> &puids = {});
```

This function builds the pipeline given:

- The first task of the original sequence.
- The first and last tasks of each stage.
- The number of threads to allocate to each stage.
- The number of buffers between stages.
- The type of waiting for the adaptor tasks.

!!! note
	AFF3CT doesn't support consecutive multithreaded stages yet.

```cpp
void create_adaptors(const std::vector<size_t> &synchro_buffer_sizes = {},
                     const std::vector<bool> &synchro_active_waiting = {});
```
This function creates the adaptor tasks that are added between every stages to
transmit data from the stage $S$ to the stage $S+1$. 

```cpp
void _bind_adaptors(const bool bind_adaptors = true);
```
Adaptor module tasks `pull & push` need to be bound to each task in the two
consecutive stages, the target sockets to bind are stored in the vector
`sck_orphan_binds.`

<a name="Adaptor"></a>
# Adaptor

Adaptors are special modules inserted between stages when creating a pipeline
and serve as "bridges" between them, they are bound to first and last tasks of
the consecutive stages. The purpose of adaptors is to synchronize data exchange
between each stage using preallocated buffer pools. There are 4 tasks performed
by adaptors:

- push_1: when the $S$ stage is executed on one thread and the $(S+1)$ stage is
  on multiple threads, the function gets an empty buffer and fills it with the
  data produced in the stage $S$. The buffers are filled using a round-robin
  algorithm.
- pull_n: when the $S$ stage is executed on multiple threads and the $(S-1)$
  stage is on one thread, it's the task executed just after the `push_1`, it
  takes a filled buffer from the interstage pool and forwards the data. There is
  a `pull_n` task for every thread of the stage.
- push_n: when the $S$ stage is executed on multiple threads and the $(S+1)$
  stage is on one thread, the task takes an empty buffer from the pool and fills
  it with the data produced by the thread. There is a `push_n` task for each
  thread of the stage.
- pull_1: when the $S$ stage is executed on one thread and the $(S-1)$ stage is
  on multiple threads, it's the task executed just after the `push_n`. It takes
  filled buffers from the pool using the same round-robin algorithm as `push_1`
  and forward the data.

## Attributes

```cpp
const size_t buffer_size;
```
The interstage buffer pool size.

```cpp
std::shared_ptr<std::vector<std::vector<std::vector<int8_t*>>>> buffer;
```
Pointers to each buffer of the interstage pool.

``` cpp
std::shared_ptr<std::vector<std::atomic<uint64_t>>> first;
std::shared_ptr<std::vector<std::atomic<uint64_t>>> last;
```
Two pointers used to monitor the buffer pool, `first` is used to get the filled
buffers, and `last` for the empty ones.

## Methods

These are the methods used to synchronize the buffer pool between the pipeline
stages. When getting a buffer, the thread may sleep.

```cpp
virtual void* get_empty_buffer(const size_t sid) = 0;
```
Get a pointer to the first empty buffer in the pool (at index last).

```cpp
virtual void* get_filled_buffer(const size_t sid) = 0;
```
Get a pointer to the first filled buffer in the pool (at index first).

```cpp
virtual void* get_empty_buffer(const size_t sid, void* swap_buffer) = 0;
```
Get a pointer to the first empty  buffer in the pool, and replace that buffer
with a new one pointed by `swap_buffer` parameter. 

```cpp
virtual void* get_filled_buffer(const size_t sid, void* swap_buffer) = 0;
```
Get a pointer to the first filled  buffer in the pool, and replace that buffer
with a new one pointed by `swap_buffer` parameter.

```cpp
virtual void wake_up_pusher() = 0;
```
The puller can wake up a push task if this one is waiting for an empty buffer.

```cpp
virtual void wake_up_puller() = 0;
```
The pusher can wake up a pull task if this one is waiting for an empty buffer.
